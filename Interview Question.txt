1. What is the purpose of EDA?
Ans: Understand data and its structure.
Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
Prepare data for further analysis or modeling.
Formulate hypotheses based on insights.

2. How do boxplots help in understanding a dataset?
Ans: Show data distribution (median, IQR, outliers).
Detect outliers and visualize spread of data.
Compare groups easily.

3. What is correlation and why is it useful?
Ans: Measures the relationship between two variables.
Correlation values: +1 (positive), -1 (negative), 0 no correlation).
Helps identify relationships between features and target.

4. How do you detect skewness in data?
Ans: Visualize using histograms/boxplots.
Calculate skewness value (Pandas .skew()).
Skewed data may require transformations (log, Box-Cox).

5. What is multicollinearity?
Ans: Occurs when independent variables are highly correlated.
Leads to unstable coefficient estimates in regression models.
Detected via correlation matrix or Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

6. What tools do you use for EDA?
Ans: Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
Plotly for interactive visuals.
NumPy for numerical operations.
Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis.

7. Can you explain a time when EDA helped you find a problem?
Ans: Found missing values in the 'Age' column during customer data analysis.
Missing values were non-random and correlated with another feature.
Addressing this improved the model's accuracy.

8. What is the role of visualization in ML?
Ans: Helps explore and understand data.
Assists in feature selection and model evaluation.
Communicates results effectively to stakeholders.
